In this project we will utilize resource theories to classify the evolution of random discrete dynamical systems (RDDSs). Resource theories are mathematical models ubiquitous in quantum information, e.g. with the theoretical study of quantum entanglement and quantum thermodynamics. For dynamical systems, resource theories allow modelling of external perturbations which act on extended time scales. During the project we will determine constraints on such stochastic perturbations and form classifications for which perturbations can act on an RDDS with a specified graph of dynamics. These results will provide information on necessary and sufficient conditions for possible state transitions due to perturbations of RDDSs. This project extends work by Dr. Scandolo and his collaborators which utilized the framework of resource theories to completely determine possible state transitions for deterministic dynamical systems under extended time scale perturbations. Additionally, this work has broad applications even outside of the quantum domain, including in genetic regulatory networks.
